		      <h1>Foo Fighters is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. 
			  Founded initially as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, 
			  the lineup now consists of Grohl (lead vocals, guitar), Nate Mendel (bass guitar), 
			  Chris Shiflett (guitar), Pat Smear (guitar), Rami Jaffee (keyboards), and Josh Freese (drums).
			  Grohl formed the project after the breakup of Nirvana in 1994 to release solo material. 
			  Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 eponymous debut album, he recruited Mendel and 
			  William Goldsmith (drums), both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. 
			  The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, 
			  The Colour and the Shape (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward.
