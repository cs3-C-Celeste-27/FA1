		      <h1>Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of 
			  California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, 
			  together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of 
			  the band's career they have been a power trio[3] with drummer Tr√© Cool, 
			  who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the 
			  band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). 
			  Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member from 2012 to 2016. 
			  Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called 
			  Sweet Children and they were part of the late 
			  1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from 
			  the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. 
			  The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. 
			  In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became 
			  a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. 
			  Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, 
			  Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream 
			  interest in punk rock in the U.S.
